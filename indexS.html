" Picturesque view of the snow clad Dhauladhars with sunny afternoons and cosy evenings for solo reading from Anu's <br>personal collection of life changing books or to just enjoy warm family get togethers.....it's a place for all <br>with positivity and good vibes flowing all around. The food is always fantastic no matter what I order.... I am<br> always delighted with my meal! The chef and the servers are efficient and happy to customize meals according to <br>one's preference. I am so fortunate to have this place just a few minutes drive away from my place!!! "

This cosy cafe has delicious food, beautiful presentation and for their <br>prices it’s 100% worth it. And off-course how can we not mention the superb interior done by the owner herself. <br>Ms Anu the owner will welcome you with warm smile and will make. Sure you have a best experience. I'd recommend <br>it as a nice place to go with friends, family or even if you alone. "

"Beautiful interiors with a clean unique look with food quality to match. The chef here is an experienced one and <br>is truly amazing. As anticipated the food is absolutely delicious and presented with care. The pizza here is <br>the among the best ones. It's fresh, aromatic and a delight. One other favorite of mine and surprisingly<br> freshly made are momos. The spicy momo chutney is unique, consistent and well, spicy. I love it. I urge you to <br>specifically request for it if you are truly a momo fan. The cafe itself is nicely put together with quality <br>furniture and decor that make up for a classy theme. There are a few books to read and a few table games to <br>play while you wait for your order which does take a little while to arrive but it's totally worth it. The <br>views are of the Dhauladhars and the city of Dharamshala and they are great."
